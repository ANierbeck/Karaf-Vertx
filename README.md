# Vertex example project running on Apache Karaf

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ANierbeck/Karaf-Vertx.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ANierbeck/Karaf-Vertx)

This is a simple sample showing how to run Vertx applications on Apache Karaf. 

This includes:
- Vertx and Bus as service   
- A customized shell to show verticles   
- A WhiteBoard Extender to register verticles as services   
- A Karaf Feature File   
- A Karaf custom Distribution for easy testing   

KUDOS to https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/master/osgi-examples for inspiring me to work on this.
